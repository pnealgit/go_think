# go_think
This is a variant of the 'think' repository. It has a go backend where every genome has
a concurrent neural network.

April 28,2017 - Finally figured out unmarshalling. Threw all the setup
code into the 'onopen' for the websocket. 

Things to do:

1. Get the genomes generated on the Go side
2. Get the neural network weights generated on the Go side
3. Get the select/crossover working on the Go side
4. Get the mutation working on the Go side
5. Get the 'Think' working that sends back the angle to the rover.
